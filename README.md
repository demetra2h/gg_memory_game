# Gilmore Girls Memory Game!
Match the characters on the cards!

There are many weird, wonderful characters in the world of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, let's see if you can remember who they are.

This is a classic memory game, just like when we were kids, flip over the card to see who is behind it and match them. If you are correct they stay face up, if you are incorrect they flip back over and you can try again. Once all the characters have been matched, you win! 

Made using jQuery for the game functionality, clicks, flips and staying face up once they're matched.
There's a click counter, to keep track of how many times the cards have been called.

CSS for the styling, I modeled the page after how a memory game would look if you were to play in the real word. I made the background of the page the town square, because it is an important part of the show.  The cards are a few characters from the show.
