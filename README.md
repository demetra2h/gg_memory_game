##Introduction

There are many weird, wonderful characters in the world of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, let's see if you can remember who they are.

##How to play
This is a classic memory game, just like when we were kids, click to flip over one card to see who is behind it, then click to flip over another card. If the cards match they stay face up, if they are not a match they flip back over and you can try again. Once all the characters have been matched, you win! There is a click counter to keep track of how many times a match has been attempted. There is a "play game" button to reset the board once all the cards have been matched.
